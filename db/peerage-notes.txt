If all remainders were there would we need a peerage type of life, already hered? SIGNIFIES HOUSE MEMBERSHIP WHERE NO HOUSE MEMBERSHIP AS HERED







Administrations: why lack of end dates? NEXT START IS END

Is subsidiary title associated with peerage? USUALLY. LORD CURZON PROMOTED TO EARL (usual remainder) + VISCOUNT SCARSDALE (male descendants ) + LORD  (sr to female descendants)

 4. There's an oddity with announcements and announcement types. Or at least in our interpretation of it. There are 14 peers with an announcement type code of 'L'. But there doesn't appear to be an announcement type code of 'L' in the announcement types table. Lord Boothby is one example.
 Sorry. I have added "L" to the list. When the Life Peerages Act 1958 came into force there was an initial list of appointments which does not neatly fit into any other category. The L (short for "Life Peerages Act") relates to that list.
 
 
 5. 1390 peerages have an announcement date that matches a date in the announcement table. But 485 do not. An example is Lord Bannside who has an announcement date of 28 May 2010 but the announcement table we have only goes up to 2001. I'm guessing this might be a translation error from the database conversion at our end.
 No, it is my fault! The dates of lists are not actually needed for the purposes of the database and I have been remiss about adding them in recent years. But I only record a list when there is one and some peerages, e.g. some appointments of ministers in the House of Lords, or the creation of the dukedom of Sussex, are one-offs. So there will be some cases where the announcement date does not match anything in the table of lists.
